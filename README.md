# First Discord Bot

###
I've decided that to learn Typescript better I am going to use the language to write Discord bots. I have never written a Discord Bot before either so I'm going to be killing two birds with one stone. Hopefully in the future I will have written much better bots with Typescript that people will get actual value out of. For now, however, this bot will most likely be limited to a simple chat bot with maybe a few extra features as well.
